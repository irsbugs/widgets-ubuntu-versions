## Using Jupyter-notebook widgets to view Ubuntu versions

Demonstration of using the jupyter-notebook widgets: Dropdown, Label, Text and Textarea.

Ubuntu LTS releases are every two years. These iso file releases are built from over 2000 software packages. On an almost daily basis an update to one of the applications becomes available for distribution. Around every six months a new iso file is produced that incorporates the all the recent updates.

Since Ubuntu Mate was released in April 2018, there have been three new full distributions released. 

This Jupyter-notebook program will retrieve the manifests of the applications and their version numbers for the four releases of Ubuntu-Mate 18.04.

Using a drop-down widget an application may be selected. In a text-area widget, the four versions are listed. For example the four *python3* application versions for 18.04, 18.04.1, 18.04.2,and 18.04.3 are:

`3.6.5-3,    3.6.5-3ubuntu1,    3.6.7-1~18.04,    3.6.7-1~18.04.`

The program requires on-line access to the internet.

The programs widgets display will be similar to the following:

Additionally there is a code cell that highlights version differences in some releases of Debian Mate Live.
